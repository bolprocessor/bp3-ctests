// These are short technical examples of how microtonality works in both Csound and real-time MIDI
// The MIDI output device doesn't have to be MPE compatible. It should only be sensitive to pitchbend messages.
// “Trace microtonality” is checked in the settings so that the details of tunings are made visible
// For a real test, play "-da.Ombres_errantes" in the "imported_MusicXML" folder

// 1) We start with plain pitchbend tests for the output MIDI device
